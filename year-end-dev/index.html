    <div class="content-wrapper">
        <p>The Salt Lake Tribune is examining the trends that have fundamentally changed the state in the 2010s. These were boom years for Utah’s population and all those new residents changed some demographic trends in big ways. Here’s a quick look at some of the major ways Utah has changed this decade:</p>

        <p>One of the biggest changes is that <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2019/11/27/first-time-fertility/">Utah’s fertility rate dropped below replacement level</a> — and essentially fell off a cliff in the past decade.</p>
        <p>“They said it would never happen here,” said Pam Perlich, senior demographer at the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. “No one who knew the old Utah ever expected this to happen — or so quickly.”</p>
        <p>The 2018 total fertility rate for Utah — the number of children each woman here would expect to have in her lifetime — has now dropped to 2.03, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. The rate to exactly replace the population over time is 2.1</p>
        <p>The new rate is less than half of Utah’s fertility rate of 4.3 back in 1960. It also comes after 11 straight years of decreases since the rate was 2.68 in 2007.</p>

        <p>Utah had the highest fertility rate in the nation for decades, but the state has dropped to No. 4 — behind South Dakota, North Dakota and Nebraska.</p>
        <p>Perlich notes that in the past it was not unusual to see Utah parents with six or more children. But she says a Latter-day Saint family is now much more likely to have four, three or even two kids.</p>
        <p>Another change is that Utahns are waiting longer to get married -- if they marry at all.</p>
        <p>The median age for Utah men at their first marriage increased from 29.6 to 31 in the decade, according to Census Bureau estimates. The age for women at their first marriage rose from 26.7 to 28.3.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of the decade, gay marriage was illegal in Utah. That changed <a class="links" href="https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=57291925&itype=CMSID">with a Dec. 20, 2013, federal court ruling here </a>— which led to a quick flurry of marriages. They were soon halted amid legal appeals but allowed again in October 2014 after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case.</p>
        <p>Now, about 4,182 gay couples are married here, according to Census Bureau estimates.</p>
        <p>The census reports Utah had 6,017 gay couples living together in 2018 in Utah, and that 69.5% of them were married.</p>

        <p>It took 119 years for Utah to reach its first 1 million residents, from when the Mormon pioneers arrived until 1966. It then took 29 years to hit 2 million in 1995. It took another 20 years to achieve 3 million. And <a class="links" href="https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=57833427&itype=CMSID">state officials have projected hitting 4 million in just 16 years, or 2031.</a></p>
        <p>A bigger percentage of that growth is coming recently from people moving to the state than from births as Utah’s recently hot economy and jobs act as a magnet.</p>
        <p>“Utah has become more and more interconnected with the global economy,” Perlich said, especially its high-tech industries that draw workers from around the world.</p>

        <p>This decline has been driven by people moving to Utah, who are less likely to be members than those who are born here, and by the slowing fertility rate.

        <p>But could this trend reverse in the next decade? <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/11/15/new-report-shows-utahs/">State officials said in November</a> that the year-to-year rate of suicide in Utah decreased this year — the first time in more than a decade. But they warned that the reduction isn’t statistically significant, and public health experts typically look for consistent reductions over three years before confirming a trend.</p>
        <p>Kimberly Myers, the state’s suicide prevention and crisis services administrator, said the recent decrease is in line with statewide changes that began around 2013 to improve coordination among health care workers, schools and state agencies on mental health interventions. The Legislature provided funding for officials to develop this unified strategy.</p>
        <p>“We, for the first time in many, many, many years, pulled together a group of stakeholders and wrote a state suicide prevention plan,” Myers said. “If you look at the science of prevention, it suggests once you start reducing risk factors, having a strategic plan and implementing it ... it’s usually about a three- to five-year process to when you start seeing reductions.”</p>

        <p>Brian Redd, the chief of the State Bureau of Investigation, said market factors could explain meth’s rapid rise. It’s about a tenth of the cost now that it was in the early 2000s, according to Redd — a pound costing between $1,000 to $1,500, with a single hit going for about $20.</p>
        <p>In some cases, meth dealers are making their way into markets where opioid use is declining, Redd said. In others, it’s replacing costlier drugs like cocaine, which is now 10 times as expensive as meth.</p>

<div class="flex-wrapper-center">
    <div class="major-heading-wrapper content-wrapper">
        <p>In the past decade, few issues were as politicized as health insurance. First, the Affordable Care Act required people to buy insurance or face a fine and offered hefty subsidies for those who had a hard time affording private coverage and did not qualify for government programs like Medicaid.</p>
        <p>That led to a decline in the number of Utahns who went without insurance, but Utah didn’t immediately expand Medicaid as the law pushed by former President Barack Obama allowed. Instead the issue became entangled in lengthy and arduous legislative debates, killed by conservatives who despised the new health care law and warned that Medicaid expansion could eventually bankrupt the government. Ultimately, voters approved a ballot measure to fully expand Medicaid — a move that was estimated to allow coverage for an additional 150,000 Utahns.</p>
        <p>But lawmakers repealed and replaced the voter-backed law with one that allowed more modest expansion of Medicaid, enough to cover an estimated 90,000 more residents. Subsequently, the federal government rejected Utah’s requested waiver for the new partial program, but after some wrangling, signed off on <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2019/12/23/feds-approve-full/">a full Medicaid expansion with some work requirements.

        <p>Utah’s relatively rapid recovery from the Great Recession came with at least one downside. Nation-leading levels of economic growth and job creation since 2010, along with the state’s renowned homegrown population increases, created exceptional demand for housing — and pushed home prices skyward.</p>
        <p>Costs for new and existing single-family homes grew over the decade at a yearly pace comparable to housing in cities such as San Francisco and San Jose. The median price of a home in Salt Lake County went up 73% in those 10 years, <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/11/19/home-prices-salt-lake/">to at least $381,000</a>, leading to similar rises in counties on and off the Wasatch Front.</p>
        <p>Incomes grew, but failed to grow that quickly. At the same time, home construction since 2010 has lagged behind Utah’s torrid pace of making new families and households, leading to <a class="links" href="https://slchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/May2018HousingReport.pdf">a gap of tens of thousands of available homes</a>.

        <p>The Salt Lake Tribune is examining the trends that have fundamentally changed the state in the 2010s. The state struggled with air quality but made some gains and saw a huge influx of tourists attracted by Utah’s natural wonders. Here’s a quick look at some of the major ways the state has changed this decade:</p>

But data compiled by the Utah Division of Air Quality paint a brightening picture over the past decade.</p>
        <p>Overall emissions of all pollutants during inversion season declined 30.5% between 2011 and 2019, from 410 tons per winter day to about 285 tons in the Wasatch Front counties. Many of the gains were attributed to reductions in vehicle emissions. PM2.5, much of which is formed in the atmosphere, consists of tiny particles that can penetrate deep into lung tissue and possibly enter the bloodstream, increasing the risk of respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease and decreased brain function.</p>

        <p>Despite an ever-increasing number of miles driven, vehicle emissions dropped by nearly half, reflecting improvements in automobile engines and the expansion of low-emission, hybrid and electric vehicles.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, the number of days the <a class="links" href="https://air.utah.gov/">Salt Lake Valley’s air quality</a> breaches the federal threshold for PM2.5 each year is on a downward trend, although the actual number goes up and down year to year in response to weather conditions. Just 2% of last year, or on seven days, did the airshed exceed the 24-hour federal limit of 35 micrograms per cubic liter. A decade earlier it had been, on average, 4% of the time, according to the state division.</p>

        <p>Old king coal is being dethroned. Utah coal production dropped precipitously since its peak in 2008 in response to disappearing demand, costing central Utah hundreds of coveted mining jobs. While the rest of the state has enjoyed economic expansion, job growth went in the wrong direction for Emery County after the closures of Deer Creek, West Ridge, Centennial and other once-productive mines.</p>
        <p>The reduction in demand stems from the rise of renewable sources of electrical generation from solar and wind and <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/05/01/kennecott-is-closing-its/">early retirement of dozens of coal-fired power plants</a>.

        <p>Last year eight mines produced 13.8 million tons, worth $454 million, a 33-year low, according to the <a class="links" href="https://geology.utah.gov/resources/energy/coal-coalbed-methane/#tab-id-3">Utah Geological Survey</a>. Utah mines employed 1,316 that year, down from 2,028 a decade earlier. The survey expected production to increase to 15.7 million tons this year.</p>
        <p>Utah’s coal country is seeking to revitalize the industry through exports to Japan, which is turning away from nuclear in the aftermath of the Fukushima meltdown and embracing coal for its power needs. Dropping coal production stabilized in 2015 when Utah’s largest producer Wolverine Fuels, formerly known as Bowie Resource Partners, began an <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2019/11/18/bay-area-city-might-ban/">aggressive export program through Bay Area ports.</a></p>
        <p>Wolverine currently ships 3 million tons a year through Richmond and Stockton. The firm hope to dramatically increase exports, but transloading capacity for coal is lacking on the West Coast and political opposition to new facilities is fierce.
