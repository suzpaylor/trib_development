        <p>The Salt Lake Tribune is examining the trends that have fundamentally changed the state in the 2010s. These were boom years for Utah’s population and all those new residents changed some demographic trends in big ways. Here’s a quick look at some of the major ways Utah has changed this decade:</p>
    </div>

<!--LESS BABIES HEADER-->

        <h6>Utah families are having fewer babies</h6>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="flex-wrapper-center">
    <div class="content-wrapper">
        <p>One of the biggest changes is that Utah’s fertility rate dropped below replacement level — and essentially fell off a cliff in the past decade.</p>
        <p>“They said it would never happen here,” said Pam Perlich, senior demographer at the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. “No one who knew the old Utah ever expected this to happen — or so quickly.”</p>
        <p>The 2018 total fertility rate for Utah — the number of children each woman here would expect to have in her lifetime — has now dropped to 2.03, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. The rate to exactly replace the population over time is 2.1</p>
        <p>The new rate is less than half of Utah’s fertility rate of 4.3 back in 1960. It also comes after 11 straight years of decreases since the rate was 2.68 in 2007.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="flex-wrapper-center">
    <div class="content-wrapper">
        <p>Utah had the highest fertility rate in the nation for decades, but the state has dropped to No. 4 — behind South Dakota, North Dakota and Nebraska.</p>
        <p>Perlich notes that in the past it was not unusual to see Utah parents with six or more children. But she says a Latter-day Saint family is now much more likely to have four, three or even two kids.</p>
        <p>Another change is that Utahns are waiting longer to get married, if they marry at all.</p>
        <p>The median age for Utah men at their first marriage increased from 29.6 to 31.0 in the decade, according to Census Bureau estimates. The age for women at their first marriage increased from 26.7 to 28.3.</p>

    <p>Back in 2011, when Utah officials began asking teens about vaping, only 1.9% self-reported they used e-cigarettes. By 2019, that number had risen to 12.4%.</p>
    <p>The same teens were asked about alcohol and tobacco use in the state’s Student Health and Risk Prevention survey, which is conducted in Utah public schools in the spring of odd-numbered years.

    <p>As of Dec. 9, there have been 115 lung injury reports connected to vaping in Utah. There’s been one death. Most of those who became ill are in their 20s and 30s, with just over 15% of cases involving teens age 19 and younger.</p>

    <p>But could this trend reverse in the next decade? <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/11/15/new-report-shows-utahs/">State officials said in November</a> that the year-to-year rate of suicide in Utah decreased this year — the first time in more than a decade. But they warned that the reduction isn’t statistically significant, and public health experts typically look for consistent reductions over three years before confirming a trend.</p>
    <p>Kimberly Myers, the state’s suicide prevention and crisis services administrator, said the recent decrease is in line with statewide changes that began around 2013 to improve coordination among health care workers, schools and state agencies on mental health interventions. The Legislature provided funding for officials to develop this unified strategy.</p>
    <p>“We, for the first time in many, many, many years, pulled together a group of stakeholders and wrote a state suicide prevention plan,” Myers said. “If you look at the science of prevention, it suggests once you start reducing risk factors, having a strategic plan and implementing it ... it’s usually about a three- to five-year process to when you start seeing reductions.”</p>

    <p>In fact, meth-related deaths surpassed street heroin death for the first time last year. In many overdose deaths, multiple drugs are involved.</p>

    <p>Brian Redd, the chief of the State Bureau of Investigation, said market factors could explain meth’s rapid rise. It’s about a tenth of the cost now that it was in the early 2000s, according to Redd — a pound costing between $1,000 to $1,500, with a single hit going for about $20.</p>
    <p>In some cases, meth dealers are making their way into markets where opioid use is declining, Redd said. In others, it’s replacing costlier drugs like cocaine, which is now 10 times as expensive as meth.</p>

<!--HEALTH INSURANCE CONTENT 1-->
<div class="flex-wrapper-center">
<div class="major-heading-wrapper content-wrapper">
    <p>In the past decade, few issues were as politicized as health insurance. First, the Affordable Care Act required people to buy insurance or face a fine and offered hefty subsidies for those who had a hard time affording private coverage and did not qualify for government programs like Medicaid.</p>
    <p>That led to a decline in the number of Utahns who went without insurance, but Utah didn’t immediately expand Medicaid as the law pushed by former President Barack Obama allowed. Instead the issue became entangled in lengthy and arduous legislative debates, killed by conservatives who despised the new health care law and warned that Medicaid expansion could eventually bankrupt the government. Ultimately, voters approved a ballot measure to fully expand Medicaid — a move that was estimated to allow coverage for an additional 150,000 Utahns.</p>
    <p>But lawmakers repealed and replaced the voter-backed law with one that allowed more modest expansion of Medicaid, enough to cover an estimated 90,000 more residents. Subsequently, the federal government rejected Utah’s requested waiver for the new partial program, but after some wrangling, signed off on <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2019/12/23/feds-approve-full/">a full Medicaid expansion with some work requirements.

    <p>The Salt Lake Tribune is examining the trends that have fundamentally changed the state in the 2010s. And it is hard to ignore the growth in the economy and its impact on wages, jobs and how and where we live. Here’s four major ways Utah has changed in the past 10 years:</p>

<!--MAIN CONTENT ECONOMY-->
<div class="flex-wrapper-center">
<div class="content-wrapper">
    <p>The economic downturn from 2007 to 2009 hit Utah hard, but not as hard as it did many other states or the country as a whole. Similarly, the Beehive State rebounded more quickly, as remnants of <a class="links" href="https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=58533998&itype=cmsid">the Great Recession</a> gave way to an economic boom.</p>
    <p>In the past decade, key measures such as jobs and <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2019/05/01/utah-ranked-no-last-year/">the state’s gross domestic product</a> — the total value of all goods and services produced — rose at record rates, <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2019/05/01/utah-ranked-no-last-year/">repeatedly earning Utah’s economy national kudos.</a> Many local businesses expanded and out-of-state companies discovered our well-educated workforce, relatively lower wages and opportunities for using outdoor recreation as a way to attract talented professionals.</p>

    <p>By 2018 — the latest year for which there is hard data — median household incomes in the state had seen a nearly 18% jump from their 2010 levels. And judging from the years since 2016, the future trajectory is upward.</p>

<div class="flex-wrapper-center">
<div class="content-wrapper">
    <p>Utah’s relatively rapid recovery from the Great Recession came with at least one downside. Nation-leading levels of economic growth and job creation since 2010, along with the state’s renowned home-grown population increases, created exceptional demand for housing — and pushed home prices skyward.</p>
    <p>Costs for new and existing single-family homes grew over the decade at a yearly pace comparable to housing in cities such as San Francisco and San Jose. The median price of a home in Salt Lake County went up 73% in those 10 years, <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/11/19/home-prices-salt-lake/">to at least $381,000</a>, leading to similar rises in counties on and off the Wasatch Front.</p>
    <p>Incomes grew, but failed to grow that quickly. At the same time, home construction since 2010 has lagged behind Utah’s torrid pace of making new families and households, leading to <a class="links" href="https://slchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/May2018HousingReport.pdf">a gap of tens of thousands of available homes</a>. The result: <a class="links" href="https://slchamber.com/housinggapcoalition/">A housing affordability pinch with wide implications</a></p>

Large numbers of households remain doubled up, with more than one family to a dwelling.

Homebuyers who can locate a bargain are often forced into longer commutes or other compromises.</p>
    <p>Renters, too, are getting squeezed, particularly those at lower incomes and residents in vital blue-collar professions. Monthly rents continue to climb, <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/09/18/apartments-continue-go-up/">even as the Wasatch Front sees historic levels of apartment construction</a>. More Utahns are “cost burdened” today, meaning they pay half or more of their income for shelter, often putting them one financial crisis away from homelessness.</p>
    <p>Together, these trends have brought <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/09/25/salt-lake-city-offers/">new urgency to debates</a> in city halls across Utah, <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/07/14/higher-density-may-help/">especially over density</a>.

    <h6>The tech sector becomes a powerhouse, attracting jobs and billion dollar deals</h6>
</div>
</div>

<div class="flex-wrapper-center">
<div class="content-wrapper">
    <p>Utah’s technology industry reached a critical mass over the decade, as the sector saw several billion-dollar IPOs and acquisitions, <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/07/30/utahs-tech-sector/">the number of tech firms in the state surpassed 6,700</a> and employment grew dramatically.</p>
    <p>Moreover, <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/02/01/after-year-big-dollar/">the notion of Silicon Slopes</a> — the cluster of Utah tech companies centered along the Interstate 15 corridor between Salt Lake and Utah counties — went from an emerging ecosystem of companies and startups in 2010 to a well-rounded sector with a worldwide reputation.</p>
    <p>That progression can be mapped in big deals. Ten years ago, software giant Adobe bought Lehi-based Omniture for $1.8 billion, in what many saw as the start of a new era in tech for Utah. Fast forward to 2018, which saw successful stock offerings by Utah companies Pluralsight and Domo — only to be capped that September by the <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/11/18/what-does-billion-deal/">$8 billion acquisition of customer-survey software firm Qualtrics in Provo by SAP</a>, a German multinational powerhouse in cloud and business services. Those data points alone, several leaders in the industry say, speak to the sector’s global presence.</p>
    <p>But the upward cycle of Silicon Slopes can also be measured in the sheer number of jobs it generates. <a class="links" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/07/30/utahs-tech-sector/">A study issued in 2019 found</a> the sector’s total economic impact in Utah had reached $29.7 billion. One in seven of all jobs in the state are now tied to the sector, accounting for more than 16% of all worker earnings and generating more than $2.5 billion in state and local taxes.</p>
