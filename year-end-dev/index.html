    <p>There we are. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Don't be bashful drop me a line. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction.</p>
    
    <p>Now it's beginning to make a little sense. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it.</p>
    
    <p>Here we're limited by the time we have. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. You need the dark in order to show the light. It is a lot of fun. This is the fun part Use what you see, don't plan it.</p>

    <p>The least little bit can do so much. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.</p>
    
    <p>Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. You can do anything your heart can imagine. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. You are only limited by your imagination.</p>

        <p>Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Play with the angles. Very easy to work these to death. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Look at them little rascals. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. It takes dark in order to show light.</p>
    
    <p>You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. We'll do another happy little painting. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Working it up and down, back and forth. And maybe, maybe, maybe... Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend.</p>
    
    <p>We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just make a decision and let it go. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Imagination is the key to painting. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.</p>
    
    <p>Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. Be brave. Let's build an almighty mountain. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Let's do it again then, what the heck. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Let the paint work.</p>
    
    <p>If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. It's cold, but it's beautiful. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. Now then, let's play.</p>

        <p>Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. Do an almighty painting with us. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.</p>
    
        <p>It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. Happy painting, God bless. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Poor old tree. This piece of canvas is your world. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. Work that paint. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.</p>
        
        <p>Every time you practice, you learn more. You can do it. Every day I learn. Working it up and down, back and forth. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. There we go. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now.</p>
        
        <p>Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important.</p>
        
        <p>Play with the angles. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. There he comes. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? The least little bit can do so much. Let's make a happy little mountain now. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.</p>

    <p>If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Those great big fluffy clouds. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. You need the dark in order to show the light. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.</p>
    
    <p>This is unplanned it really just happens. Just make a decision and let it go. A fan brush can be your best friend. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Let's have a nice tree right here.</p>
    
    <p>You can spend all day playing with mountains. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll make some happy little bushes here. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting.</p>
    
    <p>I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Zip. That easy. This is a fantastic little painting. There we go. You are only limited by your imagination. You can create anything that makes you happy. Let your heart be your guide. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too.</p>
    
    <p>You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. This is your world. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.</p>
