          <h1>What we do</h1>
          <p>We now live in an environment where it can be tough to separate reliable information from deliberately misleading or false stories. We’re bombarded with millions of sources of information everyday, from news websites to videos to social media platforms.</p>
          <p>It’s up to consumers to decide which news sources are trustworthy and which are not. And increasingly, that’s not easy. </p>
          <p>A core part of our nonprofit mission is to support media literacy and education efforts. To help parents, teachers, students — all of us, really — understand how journalism works, The Salt Lake Tribune has prepared a couple of resources for you to use. </p>

          <h1>Get to know us</h1>
          <p>We regularly host community groups and journalism clubs from middle school, high school and college. Really, we’re willing to talk with anyone who wants to learn more about the news. If you’d like to tour The Tribune newsroom or want an editor or reporter to come visit with students in your classroom, email Jennifer Napier-Pearce, <a href="mailto:jnpearce@sltrib.com">jnpearce@sltrib.com</a>.</p>
          <p>Learning how to tell the difference between fake news and real journalism is crucial for our democracy. Let us know how we can help.</p>
