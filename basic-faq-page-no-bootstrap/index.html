                <h2>Nonprofit Salt Lake Tribune Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p></p>
                <p>This nonprofit approval from the Internal Revenue Service came sooner than we expected, so more information will be coming, but for now, here are a few answers to key questions.</p>
      
                <p><strong>I’m excited to support The Tribune! How can I donate?</strong></p>
                <p>The Tribune is ready to accept your tax-deductible donation of any amount <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/donate/" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>. Your donation will be recorded as SLTRIB. Prefer to mail a check? Our address is The Salt Lake Tribune, Inc., 90 S. 400 West, Suite 700, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84111.</p>
      
                <p><strong>I’m a Tribune print subscriber. What does this mean for me?</strong></p>
                <p>Thank you for your loyalty! Nothing will change with your current newspaper subscription, billing or delivery schedule. Our contract with Utah Media Group remains in place, so if you have issues with your print account, please contact them <a href="mailto:service@utahmediagroup.com" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a> or (801) 204-6100.</p>
      
                <p><strong>I’m a digital subscriber. What does this mean for me?</strong></p>
                <p>Thank you for subscribing! Nothing will change with your current digital subscription or billing schedule. For now, your digital subscription will not be tax deductible, but that may change in the future. We will keep you posted.</p>
      
                <h1>ETC... ETC... basic boring page</h1>

                <p><strong>Will Tribune news stories change?</strong></p>
                <p>While our business model is changing, our journalistic ethics and commitment to the highest quality journalism remains the same. We will always remain Utah’s independent voice, so you’ll continue to get reliable local journalism, covering critical topics like the environment, government, sports, religion and the arts plus Bagley, a vibrant opinion page, obituaries and so much more every day. The only real change is that federal law prohibits nonprofits from electioneering, so The Tribune editorial board will no longer endorse political candidates. We’ll still weigh in on issues and policies, but we won't tell you who we think you should vote for. But please, vote!</p>
      
                <p><strong>Who will own The Tribune now?</strong></p>
                <p>Since 2016, <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/11/04/paul-huntsman-join-me/" target="_blank"><strong>Paul Huntsman</strong></a> has been owner and publisher of The Tribune. Going forward, a nonprofit board of directors will govern The Tribune. Jennifer Napier-Pearce will continue as editor and oversee the newsroom. Our nonprofit bylaws create a strict firewall between the board and the newsroom, so Tribune reporters and editors will remain free to report the news as they see fit by following the highest journalistic ethical standards.</p>
      
   
                <p><strong>Can I still advertise in the newspaper and on <a href="https://www.sltrib.com" target="_blank">sltrib.com</a>?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes. Advertisers can contact Utah Media Group at <a href="https://utahmediagroup.com" target="_blank"><strong>utahmediagroup.com</strong></a> or (801) 204-6200.</p>
      
                <p><strong>I still have questions. Who can I talk to?</strong></p>
                <p>We may not have all the answers to this innovative approach to local news, but we’re always happy to talk. Feel free to email Tribune Editor <strong>Jennifer Napier-Pearce</strong>, <a href="mailto:jnpearce@sltrib.com" target="_blank"><strong>jnpearce@sltrib.com</strong></a> or Tribune Vice President of Business Innovation <strong>Fraser Nelson</strong>, <a href="mailto:fraser@sltrib.com" target="_blank"><strong>fraser@sltrib.com</strong></a>, anytime.</p>
      
                <p><strong>I want to show my support! Where can I make a donation?</strong></p>
